## My journey through UoL
This *organization* holds a series of repositories where you will find the work I have done during my learning phase at the University of London while pursueing a MSc in Artificial Intelligence.  

### Structure
It is structured in different repositories, where each one represents one module, containing the different exercises and practices I have done. You will also find that each repository (so, module) contains different topics and other stuff such as courseworks, which are longer and more focused exercises focused in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### References
This organization contains code and references from the [MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.london.ac.uk/msc-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-structure). No code that could be used for malicious purposes (copying) should be release in a public repository. The authory of the code belongs to the person that wrote it, although many exercises have been modified for completion or correction.
